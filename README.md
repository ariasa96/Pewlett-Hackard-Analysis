#Results
The overall analysis demonstrated that Pewlett-Hackard will be experiencing a large amount of retirees soon and if they do not act soon to begin backfilling these positions, they will be later overwhelmed filling in. Thankfully, the mentorship program should provide some assistance with getting the new hires on track and receive proper training as it will be ran by collegeus who have first hand experience.
